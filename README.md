# Sika Challenge - HackZurich 2023

## Project Overview

The "Sika Challenge" project was developed during HackZurich 2023 with the aim of addressing the challenges associated with a vast, unstructured, and isolated knowledge base. These challenges include difficulties in finding relevant sources and limited real-time access to knowledge.

## Problem Statement

In today's information age, access to knowledge is essential for decision-making and problem-solving. However, many knowledge bases are unstructured, making it challenging to find relevant information quickly. Additionally, real-time access to knowledge can be a significant bottleneck in critical situations.

## Solution

The "Sika Challenge" project offers a solution to these issues by harnessing the capabilities of Large Language Models and Word Embeddings. We have developed a context-driven search system that empowers users to ask questions freely. The system then provides summarized answers based on the knowledge base, complete with references to the original sources.

## Key Features

- **Context-Driven Searches:** Our system uses advanced language models and word embeddings to understand and interpret user queries in context.

- **Summarized Answers:** Users receive concise and relevant answers to their questions, reducing the need to sift through extensive documents.

- **Source Attachments:** Each answer is accompanied by references to the sources, enabling users to verify and explore further if needed.

- **File Upload:** New knowledge can easily be added to the knowledge base. Just upload the according pdf file on the website and it can immediately be found using the search tool.

## How It Works

1. **Ask Your Question:** Users can input their questions or queries into the system.

2. **Contextual Analysis:** The system employs language models and word embeddings to understand the context and nuances of the question.

3. **Knowledge Retrieval:** Relevant information from the vast knowledge base is retrieved based on the query.

4. **Summarized Response:** Users receive a concise and informative answer that addresses their query.

5. **Source References:** To ensure credibility, the response includes links or citations to the original sources.

## Getting Started

To get started with the "Sika Challenge" project, follow these steps:

1. **Visit http://knowhere.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com:8080/**
2. **Question Statement:** Write an arbitrary question into the given window. It can be keywords, a problem description or a natural language question.
3. **Knowledge Overview:** The system proposes the best fitting sources to you and enables you to easily fact check them, sorted by relevance.
4. **Content Summary:** Our Knowledge Hub will summarize the most important knowledge within each paper regarding your question, and provide you with a concise answer.
